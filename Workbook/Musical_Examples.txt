Extended Siren Examples

There are a number of additional files with example code from my compositions
See the files in the StaleCode folder of the Siren 7.5 release, especially MusicApps-Pieces.st.

There is also a 15-minute sampler/tour of my music and the tools used to make it (almost all of them in Smalltalk) on my label's web site at
