Known bugs

This is a test release; both the Squeak and Cuis ports are work-in-progress and many features are still to be ported.  See the startup demo script for what works in Siren9c.

There are certainly many bugs in Siren.

Some of the demos don't work any more; sorry.

The SWIG code is no longer supported.

The old ManualWriter and ComposedTextEditor packages have disappeared, so the list workbook is single-font.

The MIDI and Sound I/O should probably be rewritten to use JUCE or some other modern APIs.

The display list views have no notion of pages, so longer musical examples don't display well. We need a fancier document model with page layout.
