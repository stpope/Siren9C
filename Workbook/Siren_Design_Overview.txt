Siren Design Notes

There are several elements to Siren:
	1. The Smoke music representation language		(object models for music magnitudes, events, event lists, generators, functions, and sounds);	2. Voices, schedulers and I/O drivers		(real-time and file-based "voice" objects for sound, score file, OSC, and MIDI I/O);	3. User interface components for musical applications		(a music/audio UI framework, tools, and widgets);	4. Several built-in applications 		(editors and browsers for Smoke objects); and	5. External library interfaces for streaming I/O and DSP math		(sound/MIDI/OSC I/O, fast FFT, CSL & Loris sound analysis/resynthesis packages )
Siren Design Patterns

To understand Siren's design, you should be familiar with the terminology of object-oriented design patterns, as laid out in the books "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" (Gamma, Helm, Johnson, and Vlissides, Addison-Wesley 1995), and "The Design Patterns Smalltalk Companion" (Alpert, Brown, and Woolf, Addison-Wesley 1998).

The following list introduces the design patterns found in Siren, and gives the parts of the system where they are used and a brief definition of each.

Composite -- events/event lists, display items/display lists -- class structure for building tree-like hierarchies of objects

Adaptor -- voices, ports, graphics -- interface objects translate between message protocol "languages"

Singleton -- ports, scheduler, external interfaces -- a class is limited to having a single well-known instance.

Decorator -- event modifiers, voices, layout -- one object "wraps" another and forwards messages sent to it.

Observer -- MVC, MIDI -- an object registers istelf as an "observer" of some aspect of another object, wanting to get update messages when the observed object changes.

Strategy -- layout managers, event generators, voices -- a set of classes provide a family of algorithms that encapsulate their client objects.

Proxy -- voices, ports, Smoke -- one object serves as a representative of another in some context.

Chain of Responsibility -- MVC, voices, input -- object-oriented recursion iterates through tree structures using composed command objects.

Visitor -- Smoke, voices, graphics -- active objects traverse data structures operating on them.

Double-dispatching -- Smoke -- polymorphic operators support mixed-mode operations among families of classes.

Multi-threading -- scheduler

The Siren Class Categories

The list below is the class categories (akin to sub-packages) in  Siren; this is how the classes are organized.

Music-Models-Representation -- abstract music magnitude models
Music-Models-Implementation -- music magnitude implementation classes
Music-Events -- central event classes, EventLists
Music-EventGenerators -- EventGenerators: chords, clouds, etc.
Music-EventModifiers -- EventModifiers: rubato, swell
Music-Functions -- functions of time
Music-Sound -- abstract and concrete sound classesMusic-PitchClasses -- Pitch classes (octave-independent pitch notation), chords and key signaturesMusic-PitchScales -- Scales and harmonyMusic-Support -- Scheduler, Utility, Session classes, abstract device, port and editor models

MusicIO-Voices -- Voice hierarchyMusicIO-MIDI -- MIDI voices and devices
MusicIO-OSC -- OSC streams

MusicUI-DisplayLists -- Core display items and list
MusicUI-DisplayListViews -- Basic DL views
MusicUI-Editors -- Music editors and support
MusicUI-Functions -- Function editors
MusicUI-Layout -- Layout managers for various notations
VisualWorks only:
MusicApps-CSL -- Support for the CREATE Signal Library (CSL)
MusicApps-Loris -- Support for the Loris analysis/resynthesis package
MusicApps-LPC -- Rudimentary support for linear predictive coding
MusicApps-SHARC -- Readers for the Sandell Harmonic Archive timbre database

The primary class hierarchies of Siren are given below grouped into categories. The text indentation signifies sub/super-class relationships, and instances variable names are shown.
