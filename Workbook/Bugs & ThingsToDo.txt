Known bugs

There are certainly many bugs in Siren.

Some of the demos don't work any more; sorry.

The SWIG code is no longer supported.

The old ManualWriter and ComposedTextEditor packages have disappeared, so the list workbook is single-font and can't create web pages any more.

The MIDI and Sound I/O should probably be rewritten to use JUCE or some other modern APIs.

The PortAudio sound output is pretty distorted; I should look into the buffer-passing code.

The display list views have no notion of pages, so longer musical examples don't display well. We need a fancier document model with page layout.
