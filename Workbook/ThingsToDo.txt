Status

This is a test release; both the Squeak and Cuis ports are work-in-progress and many features are still to be ported.  See the demo script on page 32 for what works in Siren9C-on-Squeak.

There are certainly many bugs in Siren.

Some of the VisualWorks demos don't work any more; sorry.

The SWIG code for Loris and CSL is no longer supported (sadly).

The old ManualWriter and ComposedTextEditor packages have disappeared, so the list workbook is single-font.

The display list views have no notion of pages, so longer musical examples don't display well. We need a fancier document model with page layout.
There's alot of stale code in the Squeak port that's vestiges of the VisualWorks world, all the displayOn: methods are old, as are all the GUIs that use VisualWorks-style set-up.

Bugs - see the test workspace below for the list of what I'm working on.
