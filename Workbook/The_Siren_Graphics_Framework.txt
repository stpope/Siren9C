The Siren Graphics Framework

The Siren graphical applications are based on the simple display list graphics framework in the categories MusicUI-DisplayLists and MusicUI-DisplayListViews. This package includes display items such as lines, polygons, curves, text items, and images, hierarchical display lists, and display list views, editors, and controllers. The display list view/controller/editor are MVC components for viewing and manipulating display lists. Simple examples of the display list framework are given below.

There are several layouts for the zoom/scroll bars; in the default layout, the bars are grouped on the left and bottom of the window. The zoom bars are gray sliders on the outside, and the scroll bars are the usual color and look, and are set inside of the zoom bars. Take a look at the following and use the zoom/scroll bars.
	[DisplayList rectangleExample] d

Note the light-blue control panel at the top-left corner of the view; this has buttons for scrolling, zooming and inspecting the display list view.  The 'o' key in the center zooms back to scale 1@1.  (Special note: the zoom-in/out buttons apply to the x-axis only if you have the shift key pressed.)

The pop-up menu has many functions that are not implemented in the top-level display list view.

There are many more examples in the display item classes, and the display list view hierarchy.

Layout Managers and Navigator MVC

The Siren version of "Navigator MVC" framework is based on layout manager objects that can generate display lists from structured objects. This enables, for example, a variety of musical notations. 

LayoutManagers take data structures and generate display lists based on their layout policies. For example, to see a class inheritance hierarchy as an indented list, use an IndentedListLayoutManager as in,

	 [IndentedListLayoutManager colorListExample display]

(Note that color denotes species in this example: red for durations, green for pitches, blue for amplitudes, etc.)

To view the same structure as a tree-like layout, use an IndentedTreeLayoutManager, as in,

	[IndentedTreeLayoutManager listExample display]

Graphical Forms

Siren includes a hierarchical dictionary of images for use in musical notations. Execute the following to display the various forms. The method below steps through the form dictionaries and displays them in a window.
